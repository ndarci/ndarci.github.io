I created this piece as a visual companion to my research paper, published in eBioMedicine in June 2023:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
<i>Cross-tissue omics analysis discovers ten adipose genes encoding secreted proteins in obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
</i></a><br/><br/>

The piece was featured alongside the article on the <i>eBioMedicine</i> website as one of three featured articles in the June 2023 issue.<br/><br/>

Process photos are included after the finished product.
