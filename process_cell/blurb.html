The Process Cell is a collage representing the entire trajectory of a bioinformatics research project, from preliminary reading to high-level data visualization.<br/><br/>

Like a biological cell, each component has its own necessary and interconnected function. Foundational papers and technical notes are the outer membrane of the Process Cell. In this stage, the domain of the project is porous, defined only roughly by disparate ideas. Blocks of code are the organelles of the Process Cell. They may not represent the essence of the investigation at first glance, but as the machinery of the project, they execute a concrete plan. Finally, clustered data visualization is the DNA of the Process Cell. Here the most highly condensed information is stored, representing every other component at once.<br/><br/>

There is beauty and importance in each step leading up to the polished output of a research project. Each phase carries an idea from darkness into light.<br/><br/>
